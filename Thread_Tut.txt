Atomic Operation- Cannot be interrupted by other threads of memory stuff.

So a non-atomic operation would be one thread has a pointer to a hash, 
and then the oher thread 

Locking is something to psuedo the non-atomic operations by creating a safe 
space for memory access.
Locks are atomic numbers in memory.

DeadLock - 2+ threads ask for the same lock and end up corrupting memory.

T1 - [ Lock1, Lock2, Unlock 2, Unlock 1 ]
T2 - [ Lock2, Lock1, Unlock 1, Unlock 2 ]

Dead things memset 0 after think loop.
