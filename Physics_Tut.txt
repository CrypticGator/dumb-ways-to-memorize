Physics:

How to make it Better:
1. Limit speed.
2. Split time segments enough so that fast entities don't skip collisions.

Space-
Setup a physics space to run your physics in.

Body-
Mass, Position, Velocity, and other physical properties.
Types (Free Body + Static Body)

Free Body = Moves freely
Static Body = Doesn't move 

Shape-
Determines the volume, and is lines connected to each other. So shapes are a mix of circles, rectangles, and lines.

Bounding Box-
The area that bodies should not escape from.

Collisions / Arbiter -
A callback function to set when two things collide.

Initial Collisions, Continued Collisions, After Collision
Initial = When they first touch.
Continued = After they touch, but they are in contact still.
After = They are no longer in contact, after having being touched.
